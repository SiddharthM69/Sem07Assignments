Newsgroup Tsang Subject Saturn Pricing Policy article fredd shuksan Fred Dickey writes CarolinaFan uiuc wrote active defending Saturn lately net would like state full opinion subject rather reply points
biggest problem people seem Saturn Dealers make car
think agree car comparably priced competitors overpriced compared cars class
understand point arguing whether dealer makes
never understood big deal dealer profits either
thing figure people believe minimize dealer profit minimize total expenses car
may true cases believe generally true
bought Saturn SL January
TIME based studying car prices decided comparable car priced cheaply Saturn
Sure maybe could talked price car Saturn price expenses would different
important much money left buy car
REDUCING DEALER PROFIT THING SAVING MONEY
Show reducing dealer profit saves money believe important
experience reducing dealer profit necessarily save money
Fred Say bought Saturn dealer profit
dealer profit would paying car
saving money
Moreover Saturn really reduce dealer profit margin cars even better deals
Say price Saturn already market average class cars reduce dealer profit would market average
Attract even people buy Saturns would SAVE MONEY
Force competitors lower prices survive
Saturn owners benefit lower dealer profit even buyers cars pay less
saving money

rpw changes April revised brake fluid section fluids apparently available rpw Commonly Asked Automotive Questions Tire Questions Q funny numbers sides tires mean
Typically see something like
overall width tire millimeters tread usually narrower
aspect ratio indicates height sidewall tire relative overall width
example tire sidewall height mm
wheel diameter inches also special tires called tires three digit metric wheel diameter designations like millimeters
R means Radial H speed rating indicating highest speed tire properly inflated carrying appropriate load may safely operate
Common speed ratings H V
Recent changes method specifying tire sizes move speed rating different part designation may therefore find designations like indicates load associated speed rating exceeding load continuous operation rated speed dangerous practice
follows table showing number load indices corresponding maximum loads Load Index Max Load Kg Note usual mass weight confusion occurs table
cases letters P LT may found front tire size LT designation indicates Light Truck P designation indicates Passenger car
letter given application tire Passenger car usage
far know letters appear US market
LT designation prinicipally interest owners light trucks utility vehicles
owner passenger vehicle meaningful difference tire P designation one designation
aspect ratio omitted probably may
Tires MS designation may speed rating reduced
additional set ratings tires temperature traction treadwear
Temperature Traction graded B C best C worst treadwear numeric rating
values limited value assigned somewhat arbitrarily tire manufacturers thus useful comparing different brands tires
Q car tires funny size designation put normal tires car
tires called TRX tires devised Michelin
somewhat different bead design incompatible normal tires Michelin used different diameter wheel could mounted wrong type wheel conventional tires could mounted TRX type wheels
need aquire different wheels put normal tire car barely possible fit normal tires TRX wheels horribly dangerous tires may simply peel rims corner possibly blow high speed
TRX type tires becoming hard find addition Michelin Avon makes suitable tires
Goodyear apparently discontinued line TRX tires
Q rotate radials side side rotate one side car
Car tire manufacturers differing views subject many say swapping radials left right hand sides car ok group includes Michelin Goodyear others example Pirelli Nokia void warranties swapping done
best advice read tire manual carefully rotating tires stick manufacturer recommendations
Q many snow tires buy buy end car put
short ends
explain many drivers areas get excessive snow drive agressively snow conditions get away two snows drive wheels circumstances dangerous practice
rear wheel drive car choose able start car going function rear axle stopping turning car function front axle
front wheel drive car start stop turn front end
primary risk putting snow tires front put brakes going downhill run serious risk going downhill backwards

Safety Equipment Q airbags really work
Preliminary statistics suggest following Airbags work much better belts good point belts alone work much better Airbags alone AirBags point belts work slightly better point belts alone
con airbags designs tend burn driver hands venting byproducts explosion occurs inside bag designs may knock driver hands wheel making retention control vehicle bag deflates difficult
Brake Questions Q always need get rotors disk brakes turned
Midas always wants

specific conditions mandate turning replacing rotors shops try make little extra money replacing rotors often strictly necessary
rotors warped warped lightly grooved need replace turn
Note also rotors rotors many Hondas good example narrow begin practical turn must replaced become thin warped badly grooved
Q tell downshift braking slow car
really good idea
used good idea back days mediocre fade prone drum brakes
modern disc brake equipped cars use downshifting slow car really necessary except cases long steep downhill runs
Otherwise modern disc brakes adequate stop passenger car circumstances much cheaper repair clutch linings
hand many standard driver license tests USA still specify driver tested downshift braking suggest taking US driver test either learn smoothly takes time practice borrow car automatic take test
Q often replace brake fluid
Probably often
Traditional brake fluids tend absorb water water corrode internal parts brake system also lower boiling point fluid
type older fluids newer specifications
principal differences wet dry boiling points dry boiling point important fresh brake fluid wet boiling point important older brake fluid
fluids lowest wet dry boiling point fluids better boiling point requirements fluids best boiling point requirements fluids clearly superior see next Q details
requirements imply fluids better fluids may specific cases fluid preferable mostly competition applications
Otherwise type fluids offer improved brake pedal feel
Replacement year recommended fluids although agressive drivers may profit changing fluid frequently least bleeding modest amount fluid brake calipers fairly regularly
Q brake fluids
breaks two parts
specification looks excellent performance first fluids Silicone based
Silicone fluids tricky proposition
Unlike fluids absorb water
may sound like feature problem water present pools systems interfering braking performance corroding metals spot pooling occuring
water tend migrate downwards braking system brake calipers corrosion occurs
phenomenon essential converting Silicone empty entire brake system flush throughly beforehand even recommend replacing rubber parts brake system converting Silicone fluids
Two issues come silicone fluids difficult pour cleanly without air bubbles interferes getting good brake pedal feel generally much higher boiling points fluids high temperature failure modes indistinguishable effect boiling fluids
SIlicone fluids may make sense street car applications certainly recommended high performance driving applications economics questionable street use
recently become aware new fluids meet standard contain Silicones fluids appear reasonably compatible older fluids little information time
Q ABS available cars looking costs
worth
cut dried answer therefore answer quite long order cover pros cons
short answer ABS costs initially maintain generally work better average driver say driver extensive experience high performance driving techniques may require unlearning obsolete braking techniques like pump braking unlearned case
long answer
ABS works monitering wheels car looking signs locked brakes
may may able able distinguish different wheels several systems market
detect impending lockup would really want ideal world existence lockup
sensors used vary less well designed sensors sensitive tire size brake pad material may cease function properly owner deviates original equipment components
sensors detect lockup ABS system responds unlocking brakes either individually depending system
driver keeps foot firmly planted ABS end cycling locked unlocked states sensor existed could detect could sit right point maximum braking effect achieved
pulsing often felt brake pedal system cycles
percentage time brakes truly engaged called duty cycle typically ABS system dry pavement trained driver beat duty cycle quite reliably using technique called threshold braking wet pavement braking chancy ABS outperform threshold braking nearly every time
Unfortunately mud snow often maximum braking effect acheived brakes locked Audi manufacturers producing cars seen fit provide disable switch ABS system eventuality
particularly important feature ABS preserves steering control
case simply braking near limit turn wheel ABS release brakes sees lockup back percentage time brakes applied
Braking distances lengthen accordingly
important caution ABS exceed maximum theoretical braking force given situation start sliding glare ice expect ABS system help much
coefficient friction changed presence ABS system car
far maintenence goes addition potential restrictions listed worry following parts costs much higher OE master cylinder obscure european sedan lists OE master cylinder version car lists
manufacturers explicitly forbid use silicone brake fluids vehicles
potential cost replacement corroded brake system components regular suggest annual replacement brake fluid becomes important
Q threshold braking business
normally put consumers Q recent publicity number accidents involving police drivers Chevy Caprices suggests section needed rpw Threshold braking technique practiced serious high performance drivers made habit replaces stab pedal lock panic habit entirely much prefered
Basically premise tires generate maximum braking force started slide wheels lock entirely
Drivers threshold brake learn feel threshold feels like learn search hit application brake pedal
many cars feel near threshold pedal starts firm depress
case ca hear tires whine bit near threshold
car ABS often twinge pedal system starts cycling driver backs pedal tad twinge felt close threshold probably achieve better stopping distances punched let ABS take
Recently rash publicity number accidents one death involving police cars equipped ABS systems
police departments question quickly blamed new ABS systems according Autoweek magazine seems clear problem lack training none involved officers recent performance driving training
reason believe drivers reacted pulsing brake pedal pump braking old discredited technique stabbing releasing brake pedal goal try get brakes back failing hydraulic system
think minute realize pump braking must cut effective operation working brake system least cut duty cycle ABS system much giving brakes wrong reason
Threshold braking advantage effective useful technique regardless whether car ABS fear failed hydraulic system one two stabs pedal sufficient
Gas Questions Q High Octane gasoline help
Maybe maybe
cars knock sensors adjust engine timing turbocharger boost suit gasoline used
cars however use cheapest gas makes car run well
Check owner manual details car needs
Q car made leaded gasoline
unleaded gas hurt
possible unleaded gas may slightly increase valve wear although Amoco Oil company argues otherwise
actual increase valve wear almost unnoticeable however modern leaded gasolines actually contain little lead
however check owner manual many cars early actually require leaded gasoline
Q fuel treatments help
kind use

winter good idea use dry gas however may harmful fuel injection systems
Never use additive containing Methanol sometimes called Methyl Alcohol additives may damage fuel systems cars carbs almost certainly damage cars fuel injection
Manufacturer opinions vary additives containing Ethanol sometimes called Ethyl Alcohol car fuel injection check manual car using
manufacturers consider Ethanol acceptable gasoline
Additives Isopropyl Alcohol Isopropanol Petroleum Distillates fine fuel injected cars
occasional bottle fuel injector cleaner helpful cars fuel injectors although many premium gasolines contain detergents job
brands fuel injector cleaners contain Ethanol Methanol always check ingredients putting anything gas tank
small number particularly good additives noticeably expensive ones work much much better
Among Chevron Techron Redline Wurth Lubrimoly Ventil Sauber BG
bottle one every six months highly recommended
Q detergent gasolines
quality detergent packages gasolines varies somewhat BMW instituted testing program gasoline brands pass test may advertise fact
Stickers indicating passage test beginning appear fuel pumps gas stations
gasolines used fuel injector cleaners probably optional
Beforewarned use BMW approved gasolines keep clean engine clean may clean motor bad valve deposits
Lubrication Questions Q numbers letters motor oil designation mean
several different items encoded
code indicating type detergent package manufacturer uses oil looks like SE SF CD
codes gasoline engine applications C codes diesel engine applications
second letter assigned sequence new levels protection developed thus SF considered better SE SE considered better SD forth
noticeable designation oil weight
either single number weight pair numbers separated letter W
latter type much commonly used days type automobile manufacturers specify operators manuals
first number designation apparent viscosity oil cold W stands winter
second number viscosity oil hot
trick oil actually get thicker turn weight weight gets hotter
actually happening oil cold viscosity cold weight oil
gets hotter get thin fast oil would time temperature viscosity hot weight oil
Note numbers actually specify ranges viscosities oils exactly viscosity cold weight oils viscosity hot
Note also novel behaviour oils caused additives reported sole exception Castrol GTX oils retain characteristics well time
oils work well though
Q quick lube places good
adequate work quite incompetent ones
Let buyer beware watch work make sure overtorque oil drain plug keep hand wallet times
Q oil additives like Tufoil good
Tufoil additives
Many come onto market recently different additives around since early
PTFE chemical name Teflon TM trademark owned DuPont
general auto manufacturers recommend use products
USENET responses questions additives favorable slight increase MPG application smoother revving long term results whether PTFE additives effective miles debatable
manufacturers Saab claim either product engine flush preceeds application causes deterioration oil seals eventual leakage
BMW owners reported death valve seals shortly addition Slick cars
writer cautioned Dealer
used Japanese motors may clog oil return passages engine
Otherwise known reports damage caused PTFE additives
hand satified Slick customers world
Q synthetic oils really work
Yes
specifically auto manufactuers accept synthetics disagree extremely long oil change intervals claimed oil manufacturers
Auto manufacturers recommend continue change oil intervals recommended owners manual car
Even decide try longer intervals least change oil filter regular intervals synthetics get dirty conventional oils
Synthetic gear lubricants manual transmissions another matter entirely Amsoil Redline AGIP highly regarded effective
Mobil synthetic gear lube gets mixed reviews however
Q Manufacturers specifying longer longer oil change intervals
often change oil
depends drive
car always nearly always gets warmed drive hard keep revs manufacturer recommendation probably fine
however drive hard drive high revs alternatively drive supermarket get temperature may wish change oil much often perhaps mile intervals given manufacturers specifying mile intervals
drive car much say miles year probably want change oil every six months anyway

Questions Q car timing belt
hear bad things happen break
story
depends internal design motor
Early Ford Escorts example suffer severe valve damage belt breaks newer cars require tow installation new belt
Honda motors damaged others
replacement interval specified car change belt least every miles cars may require frequent replacement
Ask dealer independent mechanic
Also ask related repairs take place time example Ford Escorts suffer valve damage also timing belt driven water pump known seize destroying timing belt causes major valve damage side effect
Replacing timing belt ignoring water pump costly mistake
Q would anyone stupid enough design motor self destructs timing belt breaks
performance reasons
Compromising piston design valves pistons collide requires compression ratio engine reduced significantly likely avoid valve damage economy cars performance oriented vehicles
Q causes Unintended Acceleration
final report National Highway Transportation Safety Administration concluded unintended acceleration could caused mechanical failure vehicle question time consistent physical evidence
NHTSA report goes conclude pedal misapplication vehicle operator probably cause

MILITECH tm yet another oil additive
demonstration product really impressive cheat
setup demo fairly simple
cone shaped rotor half submerged small oil sink filled motor oil
rotor powered electronic motor
metal pad pressed rotor using torque wrench rotor stopped friction
torque needed stop rotor read torque wrench
MILITECH added rotor stopped torque pick brand oil difference
MILITECH added oil rotor could stopped even torque
good part even salesman emptied oil sink still could stopped rotor thin film remained
say need add per quart oil every miles
oz bottle
still doubts
product really great little known
salesman said widely used military
believe
demo impressive bought bottle common sense
anyone heard actually used product

US currently Virgina District Columbia prohibit usage radar detectors
New York prohibits use large trucks
Canada illegal Manitoba Ontario Quebec Newfoundland PEI Prince Edward Island
apparently illegal Europe
Legislation would make illegal pending many jurisdictions chances legislation passing varies great deal
Q Radar Detector Detectors used
really work
Usage spreading rapidly initially used Canada appearing New York Virginia
unsafe assume use Connecticut
work detecting certain frequency radiated many currently available super Het radar detectors brands detector radiate strongly others thus likely spotted
New radar detectors becoming available may detected current generation detector detectors
Note detector may spotted one devices turned
Q VASCAR
kind Radar
VASCAR nothing fancy stopwatch computer
depends operator pressing buttons target vehicle passes landmarks
radar signals emitted VASCAR system
Q Ka band radar
used
radar detector able handle
Ka band recently made available FCC use US installations
installations beam aimed across road degree angle direction traffic picture taken vehicles radar unit determines violation speed limit
Tickets mailed owner vehicle
low power degree angle many people believe radar detector give reasonable warning Ka band radar unit although manufacturers radar detectors added capability anyway
number locales use limited question legality units
Best advice learn photo radar units look like keep track used else speed
Q radar jammers work
legal
Quick answer USA
Detailed answer Cheap radar jammers work well
Jammers work expensive usually property military
Jammers major violation regulations Federal Communications Commission USA
Driving technique Vehicle Dynamics Questions Q understeer oversteer
Understeer oversteer terms describing behaviour car cornering near limit limit adhesion
drivers normally drive hard enough terms descriptive situations encounter
Simply put tell whether car wants go straight corner steer less understeer wants turn corner oversteer
Understeer commonly designed production cars untrained drivers inadvertantly traveling fast wo get trouble
Understeer may also induced using much throttle corner
Oversteer designed performance oriented cars may induced lifting throttle Trailing throttle oversteer TTO
extreme cases lifting throttle may induce much oversteer car reacts fishtailing spinning
technical details corner speed tires car develop called slip angles slip angle angular difference direction car traveling direction steering wheel directing car travel
understeer front wheels greater slip angle rear wheels
oversteer rear wheels greater slip angle front wheels
Q downshift
downshifting engine must rotating faster lower gear higher gear
However downshift normally declutch lift foot throttle revs drop rather increase
downshift blip throttle clutch engine already new speed
results much smoother faster downshift
Q mean
technique used downshift braking
normally challenging need right foot brake throttle
called use one end foot brake throttle match revs downshift
many modern cars misnomer often must use ball foot brake right side throttle
Note race car drivers skip clutch use left foot brake right foot throttle accomplishing thing
Q downshifting
right foot left foot one three things nothing declutch declutch twice
reason declutching twice match speeds two shafts transmission speed engine
usually coupled engine neutral clutch engaged throttle blipped shafts transmission speed
procedure follows declutch move gearshift lever neutral engage clutch match revs declutch move gearshift lever next lower gear engage clutch sounds like lot work practice becomes natural
problem solves normally function synchronizers within gearbox
transmissions without synchros worn synchros makes much easier shift
Basically well using synchros
generally unnecessary street cars synchros good condition
Q numbers acceleration mile skidpad slalom times Auto Magazines really mean
May compared
short much magazines want believe almost never
detail acceleration numbers mile times US may vaguely compared long come source
Testing procedures vary much magazine magazine comparing Road Track number Car Driver number quite pointless
Keep mind variation applies driver driver street driver major often major part equation
Skidpads vary even skidpad figures really tests stickiness stock tires change radically tire compounds change
make assumptions comparative handling say two sports sedans based skidpad numbers
suggest skidpads without value however
Skidpads excellent educational tool driving schools
simply limited value comparison anything except tires
Slalom times slightly useful test small parts automobile transient response
However also heavily influenced stock rubber car test many corners car envelope
tell need know making buying decision
example tell rear end car road suddenly goes
car adjustable suspension tests usually done setting may quite unsuitable daily driving
list caveats could go page page
Q buddy claims wide tires make difference according freshman physics textbook ca ever accelerate corner
know talking
short got clue
detail equations friction used freshman physics textbooks presume surfaces smooth dry none properly apply tire traction except case stone cold tire dry pavement far proper operating temperature
Pavement smooth always irregular greater lesser extent
Tires really dry solid rubber substance natural form liquid coerced semblance solidity chemical magic deform match surface pavement vehicle traveling
tire operating temperature grip actually generated shear stresses inside deformed rubber anything even remotely resembling friction freshman physics sense term
colder tire relative operating temperature closer behaviour traditional concept friction much hotter proper operating temperature likely possibility part tire actually reverting liquid mostly like happen deep tread causing characteristic blisters chunking
latter though almost completely unlikely happen normal street driving unless competition driver lot high speed track driving worry
tire traction completely domain simple friction obey freshman physics equation thus dragsters accelerate race cars corner brake
simple friction apply actually possible different sized contact patches generate differing amounts grip
actual analysis tire behavior would require techniques Finite Element Analysis due complexity mechanism

Well never wrote would act described
stated would block passer
would block passer good reason prevented due traffic circumstance
fail see deterring passer circumstance would WAY decrease chances involved accident fatal otherwise
fact could imagine blocking passer would actually INCREASE chances offed involved accident especially passer riding bumper
Intentionally blocking person riding bumper certainly wise driving practice causes jam become congested
mess trucks actually watch road ahead road behind
perceive rapidly closing pack vehicles try avoid getting caught situation decribe
Usually either traffic building deal fact life wait slow passer complete pass make way pack clear
someone decides pull bumper signal intention move right first opportunity hope open jam
feel courteous driving ALOT safer actions advocate
actually many courteous drivers road intentionally impede others
someone front seems oblivious fact blocking traffic use blinker flash lights else fails briefly speed MIGHT get message faster vehicle trying pass

article lovall Daniel Lovall writes article CONRADIE Gerrit Conradie writes However design BMW electronics use counter count number times car passed million miles whatever store car computer memory
could read diagnostics test
Ditto date odometer
easy know manafucturers
prevent illegal odometer tampering
previous writer said case take aeons reset odometer mechanic electronic simulating driving car
easier reprogram

hard know much digital electronics
counter made standard TTL chips need find chip used counting figure mileage want put preset wiring preset pins directly also know conventions low high
might little involved beyond someone BSEE BS EET
display convert counter chips say digits using translation table stored ROM
selah Dan chips probably inside custom chip make smaller use less power pins going available
would probably TTL might CMOS wider operating voltage range tecnology would make much difference

find room back find car rides differently better
problem back seat leg room
Plenty head room though
Shorter people fit back without complaints long seat sitting behind pulled forward bit give place put feet
Also lot glass around expecting temperature inside car gets pretty hot summer
back seat passengers complain lack ventilation may want consider combined heat
power moonroof greatly improve ventilation throughout car
really enjoy moonroof way always sucker open air driving
leakage problems anything like yet
heard exhaust system trouble mine works fine
heard one
know early Probes maybe problems prematurely rusting mufflers Ford replace charge heard anything like concerning Probes
real trouble car outside CV joint boot leaking dealer took care promptly even gave free rental car day half without car
quite happy way handled especially considering expecting worst

dispute production cars automatics inherently lossy manuals

know sounds strange torque converter multiplies engine output launching
functions sort limited Continuously Variable Transmission
Typically get torque multiplication times depending stall speed
yet see torque multiplier installed production automobile
systems exist none presently installed production autos aware
commonly called viscous drive CVTs fluidic amplifiers
Contrasted clutch merely slips feathered result TQ mult convertor allow engine closer torque peak launch clutched car fully engage driveline
Chevy proved many years ago Camaro ETs terminal mile times close enough tpo identical speed auto cars
Note also major reason auto car get away fewer gears manual slip convertor makes fewer ratios everyone starts yelling proposed sspeed autos soon note manufacturers using speed manulas
past lauch however converter begins coupling TQ multiplication effect reduced cam

sure subaru porsche use boxer configuration inline crank analyzed compared
would care case flat four
think configuration perfectly balanced far primary secondary forces couples concerned

Bottom line biggest difference engines would probably intended use
flat easier fit low hoods rear compartments mid rear mounting
mounted transversely reduce hood length read cab forward
much fanfare differences matter Subaru ads say
Technology shared Porsche

Ever since periodically feeding clutch hydraulins additional fluid bleeding air system

add clutch original adjust pedal allow maximum extension piston master cylinder order actuate clutch

Probe looked twice local dealer purchased car first time made problem worse
second time advising service bulletin mentioned mailing list said know bulletin adjusted window made much better
However makes scritch scritch noise rough roads still squeals window wet weather anyone elses
Ford gives key car
Ford spend extra pennies
got two keys car ONE thingie
bought miles think may repossession surprised something missing horn buttons behind air bag spokes center personal preference seriously considering following advice owners manual describes procedure follow discover something Ford could cause serious injury threaten lives etc
Something notifying National Traffic Safety group well Ford
little buttons TERRIBLE
latter probably air bag
pretty much takes space expect find horn
Speaking horn surprised find Probe comes one nice sounding horns instead Japanese sounding kind
previous Probes Japanese horns
Well guess good way way bad
someone hears kind horn expect see big American car
may associate sound small jap car style car like Probe
Tires fling onto side car Yeah badly enough annoying sometimes
mudflaps help lot
transmission speed must always guy
Almost every car ever owned
got good deal car miles knowingly overlooked fact automatic
pretty automatic
fully electronicaly controlled torque converter lockup
Even automatic getting mpg highway driving
course driving illegal probably made sentence
Around town mileage around bad automatic
course control since lot city driving turns convenient
nice able drink cup coffee drive time although illegal Massachusetts noises going still
Shakes rattles main gripe
gotten fix worst fear rather harsh ride car virtual potpouri rattles gets older
Tires Goodyear Eagles left hoping Probe GL got original Goodyears driven replacement tires Bridgestone miles tradeed car

Firestones Probe look like designed performance ie rather wide shallow tread etc probably wo last long
car handles well
sticks road like glue even rough surface
interior nice
pleasing eye ergonomically sound
Definitely
nice job one
car much expensive actually look feel
Yes car stiff suspension everyone
personally like find little harsh otherwise like car strongly suggest looking
driven Probe years find suspension interesting
car actually drives much better firm ride definitely know every bump road
Yet car remains civilized even bumpiest roads
Hear feel bumps yet car retains posture well
passengers means bring along
find room back find car rides differently better
Well would encourage Probe unless person front seat likes sit knees dash
mentioned Consumer Reports consider back seat parcel shelf
biggie though bought car
definitely family car
Also lot glass around expecting temperature inside car gets pretty hot summer
MUST Probe
particular sends REAL BLAST cool air AC MAX
lots glass mentioned gives car good visibility reports see
cars good visibility
heard exhaust system trouble mine works fine
heard one
know early Probes maybe problems prematurely rusting mufflers complaints heard exhaust system GT
course different engine differeent exhaust system
one qualified free replacement
Since already replaced muffler received notice due refund Ford
applied February Still waiting
gave free rental car day half without car
quite happy way handled especially considering expecting worst
Yes
pretty amazed car adjustments past week keep overnight busy get offered pay rental
make pay taxes insurance though heard sounds like QC problems Probe probably first went production think problems mostly corrected point
almost always expected completely new car like though
agree seem QC problesm
seriously feel car design sound expect well

Right accord good car real sporty thinking selling two years dropping around sports car kind
thinking may better idea keep Accord drops buy car always wanted Corvette Stingray
reasoning accord corvette less would spend anyway
Basically thinking late early around
question good years consider reliability looks horsepower order believe horsepower main concern want go fast get motorcycle good prices
vettes basic chassis
add aluminum weaker rear housing
years used brakes similar springs etc Late bad year GM reliability
Catastrophic converter added
Cheapest corvette low end tops except morooons think indy aniversity vette special

Parts readily avail swap meets mail order etc
reliability looks independant suspension wheel disk
thought miata good deal
Also would insurance look like
male single might wait get car lower insurance
Would fact mainly drive car lower
type classic car rarely driven insurance class driving miles per year
dad vette say insurance
Basically means restricted amount driving time basically means cant used every day car would probably suit needs limited mileage
origional inquires insurance agent drive convertable miles less per year must keep locked garage cost stated value per year sound right
also looking vettes recently found convertible like dealer
currently Ford Escort GT insured State Farm
called em asked rates sell escort vette insurance per months
keep escort vette insurance per months
escort insurance goes approx per months
male good driver discount
Another variable would live
Best bet call insurance brokers get quote
State Farm says base price fair market value car determined outside apprasier
look newspaper call dealers find going rate adjust condition car
get values went selling price car
dealer asking price need research find reasonable
case told State Farm value
Get appraiser look car
check serial numbers look origional equipe

interested buying SHO five months combing classifieds Denver Chicago every week
bought remarkably clean SHO miles
far tell Blue Book still another miles Extended Service Plan runs
one SHOs made sure car already refit upgraded clutch pressure plate well recalled upgraded rotors seatbelt attachments
However SHO newer rod shifter understand get Ford service center
addition car received full miles receiving new platinum plugs valve adjustment
car miles car virtually immaculate
clearcoat paint job devoid large chips dents although front covered lots small scratches surprising since miles spent highway
driven smaller coupe long bit concerned whether could get used driving larger car
surprise size car bother seems nimble Celica
comparisons Oldsmobile
Visibility driver seat excellent helped mostly small aft door windows front rear window
Parallel parking bit difficult love size
fact starting appreciate large trunk pack drive Washington DC summer
ride later review
Engine anyone even slightly interested SHOs interested Yamaha Shogun engine
disappointed
Base performance engine rpms good
even reasonable launches second gear although make practice
engine revs smoothly eagerly tooling around town require many shifts
good since shifter definitely one weakest points car
later
performance engine rpms may unremarkable undergoes transformation hit higher revs
rpms butterfly valve opens literally hear feel geometry engine changing twelve valves open
engine soars rpm redline treated opinion sweetest sounding around
engine inexplicably sounds OVERJOYED rpm
noticed drive around town constantly watch tach see far rpm
go rpm may punch accelerator torque adequate come fully online valves used
Transmission first reviewed car marvelled Ford put wimpy clutch balky shifter car
remember driving friend parent SHO remember thinking whether leg strength drive car traffic clutch stiff
back
entire clutch assembly SHO replaced Ford recall
clutch SHO feels stiffer one Toyota Celica
fact friction point seems bit larger forgiving
playing shifter car parked shifter felt reasonable
gates expect shifting action smooth
road much shift SLOWLY
Make mistake clumsy shifter
hurrying shifts like initially trying impress friends consistently miss shift often grope clumsily shift sometimes even muff shift
find pretty amazing car like
also took several days realize get smoothest shifts take time
Seems obvious compared Toyota friend Honda seems atrocious clumsy
Someone noted CRXs blow SHOs incredibly clumsy shifter
shift much sedately shifter seems reasonable
play within bounds shifter works smoothly surprises
know whether rod shifter upgrade would help
Along lines initially trouble shifting gears smoothly
slowing shifts taking care match revs letting clutch helped immensely
took several days get hang
think problems never car enough power balk bad shifts higher gears
Occasionally trouble shifting reverse
shifter refuses enter gate often grind synchros trying get gear
watching carefully next couple months
quirk upshift engine drops back rpm hear whirring grinding noise coming engine compartment
terribly loud passenger definitely hear
asked looking car passengers
Apparently definitely SHO sound gearbox apparently called gear rollover
Replies queries end review
Exterior mentioned astounded well body SHO stood
Paint chipping front bumper grille virtually
Looking older Tauri sometimes age gracefully wonder guys Ford differently SHO bodies
body opinion extremely attractive matching color body moldings stock Tauri
odd reason SHO seems different enough vanilla Tauri get stares stoplights course could overactive imagination
SHOs get fog lights open grille completely monochromatic exterior deeper ground skirt back SHO stenciled relief
seen couple SHOs whose owners colored florescent colors black
Yuck
think car flashy
like way
feel almost anonymous Tauri different distinctive enough us care
Interior interior really makes feel like deserve car
seats grey leather steering wheel shifter covered black leather entire instrument panel done scheme
instrumentation stock Taurus except mph speedo rpm tach

Hey really impressed ergonomics thoughtfulness went design
interior upgraded
backseat bigger car

comments please
driver passenger seat lumbar side bolsters

Mine exception
left side bolster driver cracked convinced right bolster inflating way
big surprise forgot SHOs normal hand parking brake
Instead regular parking brake press left foot
bad
getting used seems bit anachronistic
Ride suspension nice stiff

stiffer car
friend new Toyota Celica ST seems tauter still able soak bumps better
SHO seems stiffer less ability soak bumps
Driving railroad tracks noisy jarring affair
hand taking turns feels wonderful body rigid flex listened bought car
highway ride great
drove car Chicago back Purdue trouble keeping mph let alone trying see mph really feels like
relatively quiet ride sunroof rattles
tried find exactly makes noise seems window rests rails
easy way get rid think
past three days oscillated thinking suspension wonderful perfect thinking ride way rough

wonder whether would advise dad buy one
discovered shifter take time shifts reason complain
Let explain
ride worst turning applying lots power wheels
feel wheels scrabbling traction torque steer making car skitter left right
understood avoid limits traction happy camper
body rigidity composure car
matching suspension steering feel quite heavy
first impression driving SHO hard turn wheel highway speeds
tracks straight arrow driving around parking lot steering seem useful
However reasonable communicate road driver well Ford Probe GT
IMHO much better steering Celica ST
wonder bad car winter
Miscellaneous notes GRIPES rattles sunroof intermittent days rattles loudly days look wondering noise went
Activating sunroof sometimes noisy loud squealing retracts rails
wonder quick fix
days completely disappears
Function humidity
made connection sometimes awful feeling suspension torque steer never complained ride
wish seats support thighs
Also wish side bolsters would close tightly
hear tires car get really expensive
currently Goodyear cost previous owner four
used hate Ford stereo systems whose idea use volume paddle
amazement really mind sometimes think okay idea
Pretty ridiculous though
Getting rpm sometimes seems chore
big deal
enough torque low
often goof shifting driving friends
took couple days could really shift smoothly gear
Hard believe
car almost miles
parents noted almost impossible find SHO
Astute observation IMHO
wonder long make SHO last bought book titled Drive Forever tips department
goofy parking brake pedal still throws loop
parked car gear accidentally let clutch started
car jolted forward bounced car front paint damage starting car whole new ritual fangled pedal
Also began wonder strong brake really
Today backed parking spot today started drive away noticed glowing brake light

Newsgroup eliot eliot Subject REVIEW Audi quattro since reviewed car today paid visit old friend whose love Audis overwhelming makes sucessful living selling
Without delay get Audi Servotronic steering familiar Servotronic name speed variable power steering manufactured ZF used Audis BMWs
outspoken damming Servotronic past couple months based magazine reviews drives Audi CS quattro Audi fwd
quite happy report Servotronic inoffensive
suppose due fat gumball tires Servotronic loaded far best implementation tried
far perfect mind much happier option could refuse longer consider bad enough feel entire car ruined
steering still tad light accurate suppose stiffly sprung chassis sends back much information makes driver hands
feel accuracy steering
also room improvement
consider steering better Japanese competition primarily Japanese believe feel engineer completely
Engine Wheee
pressure cooker
miles clock expect producing anywhere close putting miles later still car packs terrific punch
turbocharged machine unusual encourages lazy driving

low revs high gear
supremely flexible one could hardly believe liters displacement move pound car around fashion
maximum torque available rpm rpm redline car pretty much left third day translates speed range something like mph
chracteristic one normally associates large capacity
technical achievement breadthtaking
Throttle response right good atmospheric engine
fact would even put peaky multivalve engines shame
Downshifts almost unnecessary
fun use overboost feature rev engine
familiar engine features seconds additional turbo boost passing
Sort like lighting burners jet fighter one could right foot third gear blast car moments simply flooring gas
far numbers go maximum torque available overboost mode shoots lb ft incredible liter
takes moments develop overboost well worth waiting
Since quite heavy car one body parts flung around like say Corrado
acceleration smooth strong somewhat similar riding jetliner accelerates runway takeoff
Also one treated distinctive entertaining whistle turbo entertaining sound come refined bland sounding banger
Yes Audi refined point rpm sounds serene
smoothness outstanding quite standards good
valve BMW
say terms refinement
willingness rev smoothness lack harshness full acceleration better many
However lost refinement process characteristic cylinder bark made older engines characterful terribly refined
valve turbo sounds pretty bland except whistle full boost
Subjectively rate VW engine far musical turbo Also Audi also far musical rorty race car growl pressed though none match grunt
hint engine true capacity occurs one taking rest turbo come near stop
extra inertia permanently engaged system one somewhat delicate feeding clutch prevent embarassing stall
Alternately one could use revs
cases small price pay fantastic engine
think Audi America offer automatic option car offer though extremely small numbers speed much peakier
characteristics engine perfect automatic
Ironically europe slush available none offered land slush
Marketing twits rearing ugly heads Chassis noticed Audis tend wide wheels relatively modest tire widths
car comes Firestones size uncommon
However attractive spoke wheels less inches wide sidewall bulge whatsoever
Combined flared wheel arches mouth watering macho yet subdued look
rough concrete becomes immediately clear new body style made significant advances structural rigidity well road noise suppression
suppose two digress
use cliche body feels like carved stone
Flex totally undetectable even going rough roads
super rigid body like stiff springs stiff dampers cause excessive harshness ride quality never worry Lexus also draw comparisons trucks pony cars
servotronic steering already mentioned
consider inoffensive inhibit spirited cornering
able test car cornering powers without much trepidation
think new concept work car
fat gumball tires talking understeer oversteer practically meaningless
banked highway ramp went slow started applying power went around
could feel g forces build point skin face tugged sideways
Yet car totally completely obedient throttle steering inputs
felt limits even close approached
g forces thrilling entire affair going around curve strangely uninvolving
tell car want
End story
think starting relate reviewers highly impressed Honda NSX clinical efficiency unable fall love car
brakes good firmness stop car pretty well though read prone fade
surprised since uprated brakes base Audi fwd
Harder pads would help turn would lead wooden response cold
starting see trend among sedan makers extra weight offset additional braking capacity
fade performance nothing brag neither Legend
Brake fade days seem forgotten virtue everybody attention focused capability
Comfort car sporty abilities comfort levels also excellent
cabin beautifully appointed panel inserts place wood trim
expected gizmos heated seats power seats seat memory power
glaring ommision trip computer removed Audi gotten work reliably yet means car boost gauge
real disappointment taking account much turbo dominates performance
Unusual germans comes Honda style moonroof well intelligent rotary switch
Noise levels including engine tire noise low consider Lexus advantage area significant enough sway potential buyer
Conclusion Even though able afford Audi sticker price car bargain one takes account offer competition
valve turbo real gem even produce Ferrari sounds
sedan maker offers utter security quattro wheel drive worth extra money
safety features also top notch side impact standard compliant elegant automatic seat belt tensioners dual airbags
series Audis outstanding government crash tests
gets thumbs overwhelmingly capable rather exciting intoxicating

Thanks Jim good comments opinion



understand tell microwaves coming front rear
two antennas
coming interpreted side bogey
Bogey counts determined sources relative strength one another even reflections source



sounds like analysis based hypothesis actually using
like give feedback based real life experince
keep advanced logic mode rarely lights Christmas tree
time middle major shopping area makes sense since sources coming many different directions
found consistent reporting bogeys regardless moving cars area
found directional indication useful
one case two radar traps set within one mile
passed first radar trap direction indication changed
detector set pointing forward direction
radar detectors would assumed due reflection
knew high probability another trap

occasions directional helped discern false alarm true alarm
example pass source direction indicator changes
directional also allows focus attention signal might coming instead look place
car approaching rear detector leaks tell signal coming rear car passes verify source
detectors would unable would assume radar trap none
several months find added features useful gimmicks

shock sensor adjustable two cycles
adjust sensitive enough way could open hood without setting alarm
Although know pop hood Syclone without setting alarm yet zero none
false alarms system

able trace every alarm cause false alarm
also wondering easy would thief crawl underneath car cut battery cable disable alarm

really think someone wants car bad alarm wo keep even supplemental power supply
Viper also sells fancy field disturbance sensor supposedly detects people approcahing car primarily convertibles
convertible looked feature detail
Alpine actually makes better radar unit want get one
zones shut independently one side car pedestrian traffic something else would trigger alarm shuts zone rather pulls tighter
see real benefit unless convertible leave top

radar detector able handle
Ka band recently made available FCC use US installations
installations beam aimed across road degree angle direction traffic picture taken vehicles radar unit determines violation speed limit

low power degree angle many people believe radar detector give reasonable warning Ka band radar unit although manufacturers radar detectors added capability anyway
number locales use limited question legality units
Best advice learn photo radar units look like keep track used else speed
Photo radar mailed tickets make sense
Speeding moving violation committed operator owner
owner may rental agency dealer private party government agency
long owner reason expect operator driving illegally unsafely owner held responsible operator
car may even driven without owner knowledge consent

rpw changes April revised brake fluid section fluids apparently available rpw Commonly Asked Automotive Questions Tire Questions Q funny numbers sides tires mean
Typically see something like
overall width tire millimeters tread usually narrower
aspect ratio indicates height sidewall tire relative overall width
example tire sidewall height mm
wheel diameter inches also special tires called tires three digit metric wheel diameter designations like millimeters
R means Radial H speed rating indicating highest speed tire properly inflated carrying appropriate load may safely operate
Common speed ratings H V
Recent changes method specifying tire sizes move speed rating different part designation may therefore find designations like indicates load associated speed rating exceeding load continuous operation rated speed dangerous practice
follows table showing number load indices corresponding maximum loads Load Index Max Load Kg Note usual mass weight confusion occurs table
cases letters P LT may found front tire size LT designation indicates Light Truck P designation indicates Passenger car
letter given application tire Passenger car usage
far know letters appear US market
LT designation prinicipally interest owners light trucks utility vehicles
owner passenger vehicle meaningful difference tire P designation one designation
aspect ratio omitted probably may
Tires MS designation may speed rating reduced
additional set ratings tires temperature traction treadwear
Temperature Traction graded B C best C worst treadwear numeric rating
values limited value assigned somewhat arbitrarily tire manufacturers thus useful comparing different brands tires
Q car tires funny size designation put normal tires car
tires called TRX tires devised Michelin
somewhat different bead design incompatible normal tires Michelin used different diameter wheel could mounted wrong type wheel conventional tires could mounted TRX type wheels
need aquire different wheels put normal tire car barely possible fit normal tires TRX wheels horribly dangerous tires may simply peel rims corner possibly blow high speed
TRX type tires becoming hard find addition Michelin Avon makes suitable tires
Goodyear apparently discontinued line TRX tires
Q rotate radials side side rotate one side car
Car tire manufacturers differing views subject many say swapping radials left right hand sides car ok group includes Michelin Goodyear others example Pirelli Nokia void warranties swapping done
best advice read tire manual carefully rotating tires stick manufacturer recommendations
Q many snow tires buy buy end car put
short ends
explain many drivers areas get excessive snow drive agressively snow conditions get away two snows drive wheels circumstances dangerous practice
rear wheel drive car choose able start car going function rear axle stopping turning car function front axle
front wheel drive car start stop turn front end
primary risk putting snow tires front put brakes going downhill run serious risk going downhill backwards

Safety Equipment Q airbags really work
Preliminary statistics suggest following Airbags work much better belts good point belts alone work much better Airbags alone AirBags point belts work slightly better point belts alone
con airbags designs tend burn driver hands venting byproducts explosion occurs inside bag designs may knock driver hands wheel making retention control vehicle bag deflates difficult
Brake Questions Q always need get rotors disk brakes turned
Midas always wants

specific conditions mandate turning replacing rotors shops try make little extra money replacing rotors often strictly necessary
rotors warped warped lightly grooved need replace turn
Note also rotors rotors many Hondas good example narrow begin practical turn must replaced become thin warped badly grooved
Q tell downshift braking slow car
really good idea
used good idea back days mediocre fade prone drum brakes
modern disc brake equipped cars use downshifting slow car really necessary except cases long steep downhill runs
Otherwise modern disc brakes adequate stop passenger car circumstances much cheaper repair clutch linings
hand many standard driver license tests USA still specify driver tested downshift braking suggest taking US driver test either learn smoothly takes time practice borrow car automatic take test
Q often replace brake fluid
Probably often
Traditional brake fluids tend absorb water water corrode internal parts brake system also lower boiling point fluid
type older fluids newer specifications
principal differences wet dry boiling points dry boiling point important fresh brake fluid wet boiling point important older brake fluid
fluids lowest wet dry boiling point fluids better boiling point requirements fluids best boiling point requirements fluids clearly superior see next Q details
requirements imply fluids better fluids may specific cases fluid preferable mostly competition applications
Otherwise type fluids offer improved brake pedal feel
Replacement year recommended fluids although agressive drivers may profit changing fluid frequently least bleeding modest amount fluid brake calipers fairly regularly
Q brake fluids
breaks two parts
specification looks excellent performance first fluids Silicone based
Silicone fluids tricky proposition
Unlike fluids absorb water
may sound like feature problem water present pools systems interfering braking performance corroding metals spot pooling occuring
water tend migrate downwards braking system brake calipers corrosion occurs
phenomenon essential converting Silicone empty entire brake system flush throughly beforehand even recommend replacing rubber parts brake system converting Silicone fluids
Two issues come silicone fluids difficult pour cleanly without air bubbles interferes getting good brake pedal feel generally much higher boiling points fluids high temperature failure modes indistinguishable effect boiling fluids
SIlicone fluids may make sense street car applications certainly recommended high performance driving applications economics questionable street use
recently become aware new fluids meet standard contain Silicones fluids appear reasonably compatible older fluids little information time
Q ABS available cars looking costs
worth
cut dried answer therefore answer quite long order cover pros cons
short answer ABS costs initially maintain generally work better average driver say driver extensive experience high performance driving techniques may require unlearning obsolete braking techniques like pump braking unlearned case
long answer
ABS works monitering wheels car looking signs locked brakes
may may able able distinguish different wheels several systems market
detect impending lockup would really want ideal world existence lockup
sensors used vary less well designed sensors sensitive tire size brake pad material may cease function properly owner deviates original equipment components
sensors detect lockup ABS system responds unlocking brakes either individually depending system
driver keeps foot firmly planted ABS end cycling locked unlocked states sensor existed could detect could sit right point maximum braking effect achieved
pulsing often felt brake pedal system cycles
percentage time brakes truly engaged called duty cycle typically ABS system dry pavement trained driver beat duty cycle quite reliably using technique called threshold braking wet pavement braking chancy ABS outperform threshold braking nearly every time
Unfortunately mud snow often maximum braking effect acheived brakes locked Audi manufacturers producing cars seen fit provide disable switch ABS system eventuality
particularly important feature ABS preserves steering control
case simply braking near limit turn wheel ABS release brakes sees lockup back percentage time brakes applied
Braking distances lengthen accordingly
important caution ABS exceed maximum theoretical braking force given situation start sliding glare ice expect ABS system help much
coefficient friction changed presence ABS system car
far maintenence goes addition potential restrictions listed worry following parts costs much higher OE master cylinder obscure european sedan lists OE master cylinder version car lists
manufacturers explicitly forbid use silicone brake fluids vehicles
potential cost replacement corroded brake system components regular suggest annual replacement brake fluid becomes important
Q threshold braking business
normally put consumers Q recent publicity number accidents involving police drivers Chevy Caprices suggests section needed rpw Threshold braking technique practiced serious high performance drivers made habit replaces stab pedal lock panic habit entirely much prefered
Basically premise tires generate maximum braking force started slide wheels lock entirely
Drivers threshold brake learn feel threshold feels like learn search hit application brake pedal
many cars feel near threshold pedal starts firm depress
case ca hear tires whine bit near threshold
car ABS often twinge pedal system starts cycling driver backs pedal tad twinge felt close threshold probably achieve better stopping distances punched let ABS take
Recently rash publicity number accidents one death involving police cars equipped ABS systems
police departments question quickly blamed new ABS systems according Autoweek magazine seems clear problem lack training none involved officers recent performance driving training
reason believe drivers reacted pulsing brake pedal pump braking old discredited technique stabbing releasing brake pedal goal try get brakes back failing hydraulic system
think minute realize pump braking must cut effective operation working brake system least cut duty cycle ABS system much giving brakes wrong reason
Threshold braking advantage effective useful technique regardless whether car ABS fear failed hydraulic system one two stabs pedal sufficient
Gas Questions Q High Octane gasoline help
Maybe maybe
cars knock sensors adjust engine timing turbocharger boost suit gasoline used
cars however use cheapest gas makes car run well
Check owner manual details car needs
Q car made leaded gasoline
unleaded gas hurt
possible unleaded gas may slightly increase valve wear although Amoco Oil company argues otherwise
actual increase valve wear almost unnoticeable however modern leaded gasolines actually contain little lead
however check owner manual many cars early actually require leaded gasoline
Q fuel treatments help
kind use

winter good idea use dry gas however may harmful fuel injection systems
Never use additive containing Methanol sometimes called Methyl Alcohol additives may damage fuel systems cars carbs almost certainly damage cars fuel injection
Manufacturer opinions vary additives containing Ethanol sometimes called Ethyl Alcohol car fuel injection check manual car using
manufacturers consider Ethanol acceptable gasoline
Additives Isopropyl Alcohol Isopropanol Petroleum Distillates fine fuel injected cars
occasional bottle fuel injector cleaner helpful cars fuel injectors although many premium gasolines contain detergents job
brands fuel injector cleaners contain Ethanol Methanol always check ingredients putting anything gas tank
small number particularly good additives noticeably expensive ones work much much better
Among Chevron Techron Redline Wurth Lubrimoly Ventil Sauber BG
bottle one every six months highly recommended
Q detergent gasolines
quality detergent packages gasolines varies somewhat BMW instituted testing program gasoline brands pass test may advertise fact
Stickers indicating passage test beginning appear fuel pumps gas stations
gasolines used fuel injector cleaners probably optional
Beforewarned use BMW approved gasolines keep clean engine clean may clean motor bad valve deposits
Lubrication Questions Q numbers letters motor oil designation mean
several different items encoded
code indicating type detergent package manufacturer uses oil looks like SE SF CD
codes gasoline engine applications C codes diesel engine applications
second letter assigned sequence new levels protection developed thus SF considered better SE SE considered better SD forth
noticeable designation oil weight
either single number weight pair numbers separated letter W
latter type much commonly used days type automobile manufacturers specify operators manuals
first number designation apparent viscosity oil cold W stands winter
second number viscosity oil hot
trick oil actually get thicker turn weight weight gets hotter
actually happening oil cold viscosity cold weight oil
gets hotter get thin fast oil would time temperature viscosity hot weight oil
Note numbers actually specify ranges viscosities oils exactly viscosity cold weight oils viscosity hot
Note also novel behaviour oils caused additives reported sole exception Castrol GTX oils retain characteristics well time
oils work well though
Q quick lube places good
adequate work quite incompetent ones
Let buyer beware watch work make sure overtorque oil drain plug keep hand wallet times
Q oil additives like Tufoil good
Tufoil additives
Many come onto market recently different additives around since early
PTFE chemical name Teflon TM trademark owned DuPont
general auto manufacturers recommend use products
USENET responses questions additives favorable slight increase MPG application smoother revving long term results whether PTFE additives effective miles debatable
manufacturers Saab claim either product engine flush preceeds application causes deterioration oil seals eventual leakage
BMW owners reported death valve seals shortly addition Slick cars
writer cautioned Dealer
used Japanese motors may clog oil return passages engine
Otherwise known reports damage caused PTFE additives
hand satified Slick customers world
Q synthetic oils really work
Yes
specifically auto manufactuers accept synthetics disagree extremely long oil change intervals claimed oil manufacturers
Auto manufacturers recommend continue change oil intervals recommended owners manual car
Even decide try longer intervals least change oil filter regular intervals synthetics get dirty conventional oils
Synthetic gear lubricants manual transmissions another matter entirely Amsoil Redline AGIP highly regarded effective
Mobil synthetic gear lube gets mixed reviews however
Q Manufacturers specifying longer longer oil change intervals
often change oil
depends drive
car always nearly always gets warmed drive hard keep revs manufacturer recommendation probably fine
however drive hard drive high revs alternatively drive supermarket get temperature may wish change oil much often perhaps mile intervals given manufacturers specifying mile intervals
drive car much say miles year probably want change oil every six months anyway
storing car winter change oil storing change oil bring storage
Misc
Questions Q car timing belt
hear bad things happen break
story
depends internal design motor
Early Ford Escorts example suffer severe valve damage belt breaks newer cars require tow installation new belt
Honda motors damaged others
replacement interval specified car change belt least every miles cars may require frequent replacement
Ask dealer independent mechanic
Also ask related repairs take place time example Ford Escorts suffer valve damage also timing belt driven water pump known seize destroying timing belt causes major valve damage side effect
Replacing timing belt ignoring water pump costly mistake
Q would anyone stupid enough design motor self destructs timing belt breaks
performance reasons
Compromising piston design valves pistons collide requires compression ratio engine reduced significantly likely avoid valve damage economy cars performance oriented vehicles
Q causes Unintended Acceleration
final report National Highway Transportation Safety Administration concluded unintended acceleration could caused mechanical failure vehicle question time consistent physical evidence
NHTSA report goes conclude pedal misapplication vehicle operator probably cause

US currently Virgina District Columbia prohibit usage radar detectors
New York prohibits use large trucks
Canada illegal Manitoba Ontario Quebec Newfoundland PEI Prince Edward Island
apparently illegal Europe
Legislation would make illegal pending many jurisdictions chances legislation passing varies great deal
Q Radar Detector Detectors used
really work
Usage spreading rapidly initially used Canada appearing New York Virginia
unsafe assume use Connecticut
work detecting certain frequency radiated many currently available super Het radar detectors brands detector radiate strongly others thus likely spotted
New radar detectors becoming available may detected current generation detector detectors
Note detector may spotted one devices turned
Q VASCAR
kind Radar
VASCAR nothing fancy stopwatch computer
depends operator pressing buttons target vehicle passes landmarks
radar signals emitted VASCAR system
Q Ka band radar
used
radar detector able handle
Ka band recently made available FCC use US installations
installations beam aimed across road degree angle direction traffic picture taken vehicles radar unit determines violation speed limit
Tickets mailed owner vehicle
low power degree angle many people believe radar detector give reasonable warning Ka band radar unit although manufacturers radar detectors added capability anyway
number locales use limited question legality units
Best advice learn photo radar units look like keep track used else speed
Q radar jammers work
legal
Quick answer USA
Detailed answer Cheap radar jammers work well
Jammers work expensive usually property military
Jammers major violation regulations Federal Communications Commission USA
Driving technique Vehicle Dynamics Questions Q understeer oversteer
Understeer oversteer terms describing behaviour car cornering near limit limit adhesion
drivers normally drive hard enough terms descriptive situations encounter
Simply put tell whether car wants go straight corner steer less understeer wants turn corner oversteer
Understeer commonly designed production cars untrained drivers inadvertantly traveling fast wo get trouble
Understeer may also induced using much throttle corner
Oversteer designed performance oriented cars may induced lifting throttle Trailing throttle oversteer TTO
extreme cases lifting throttle may induce much oversteer car reacts fishtailing spinning
technical details corner speed tires car develop called slip angles slip angle angular difference direction car traveling direction steering wheel directing car travel
understeer front wheels greater slip angle rear wheels
oversteer rear wheels greater slip angle front wheels
Q downshift
downshifting engine must rotating faster lower gear higher gear
However downshift normally declutch lift foot throttle revs drop rather increase
downshift blip throttle clutch engine already new speed
results much smoother faster downshift
Q mean
technique used downshift braking
normally challenging need right foot brake throttle
called use one end foot brake throttle match revs downshift
many modern cars misnomer often must use ball foot brake right side throttle
Note race car drivers skip clutch use left foot brake right foot throttle accomplishing thing
Q downshifting
right foot left foot one three things nothing declutch declutch twice
reason declutching twice match speeds two shafts transmission speed engine
usually coupled engine neutral clutch engaged throttle blipped shafts transmission speed
procedure follows declutch move gearshift lever neutral engage clutch match revs declutch move gearshift lever next lower gear engage clutch sounds like lot work practice becomes natural
problem solves normally function synchronizers within gearbox
transmissions without synchros worn synchros makes much easier shift
Basically well using synchros
generally unnecessary street cars synchros good condition
Q numbers acceleration mile skidpad slalom times Auto Magazines really mean
May compared
short much magazines want believe almost never
detail acceleration numbers mile times US may vaguely compared long come source
Testing procedures vary much magazine magazine comparing Road Track number Car Driver number quite pointless
Keep mind variation applies driver driver street driver major often major part equation
Skidpads vary even skidpad figures really tests stickiness stock tires change radically tire compounds change
make assumptions comparative handling say two sports sedans based skidpad numbers
suggest skidpads without value however
Skidpads excellent educational tool driving schools
simply limited value comparison anything except tires
Slalom times slightly useful test small parts automobile transient response
However also heavily influenced stock rubber car test many corners car envelope
tell need know making buying decision

Q buddy claims wide tires make difference according freshman physics textbook ca ever accelerate corner
know talking
short got clue
detail equations friction used freshman physics textbooks presume surfaces smooth dry none properly apply tire traction except case stone cold tire dry pavement far proper operating temperature
Pavement smooth always irregular greater lesser extent
Tires really dry solid rubber substance natural form liquid coerced semblance solidity chemical magic deform match surface pavement vehicle traveling
tire operating temperature grip actually generated shear stresses inside deformed rubber anything even remotely resembling friction freshman physics sense term
colder tire relative operating temperature closer behaviour traditional concept friction much hotter proper operating temperature likely possibility part tire actually reverting liquid mostly like happen deep tread causing characteristic blisters chunking
latter though almost completely unlikely happen normal street driving unless competition driver lot high speed track driving worry
tire traction completely domain simple friction obey freshman physics equation thus dragsters accelerate race cars corner brake
simple friction apply actually possible different sized contact patches generate differing amounts grip
actual analysis tire behavior would require techniques Finite Element Analysis due complexity mechanism

Newsgroup keys Lawrence Keys Subject Alarm systems worthwhile
article dodson Dave Dodson writes worthwhile get alarm system new car
Although others past continue disagree think worthwhile get alarm
features important
think important protect trunk engine bay doors
get flashing lights LED mounted drivers passenger door relay disable engine operation
Toss glass break sensor shock sensor
Door lock unlock two remotes panic feature also nice
important installation done
places may cost little poorly installed alarm matter much cost major burden
features unimportant
IMO things like engine starters voice alarms open close conveniences

considering Probe Accord Corolla
Probe youngest bunch thus interest opinions
every magazine ratings book places excellent value
BTW drive due
Thanks Advance
read normally read group looking Valentine radar information sigh maybe FAQ came across posting
bought Probe GT PEP last July miles debating Sentra Stealth Prelude Celica
Check month Consumer Reports previous Probe records
criteria fun car ABS airbag less
thought turbo checking insurance people ruled
cars since air bag
Ditto Mustang also ABS
fell category
good used car buy
almost rolled liked
like Prelude
weird
much smaller space needed went
Celica ok underpowered loaded options somewhat overpriced form
never considered since airbag
look RWD virtues
Corolla never entered mind
looked Mitsubishi Stealth
Since list exhausted bought Probe
car design different earlier years early see reliability far
worth comments dislikes Shutting door windows inside rarely makes good wind seal
Headlights stuck times weather
air conditioning broke miles pressure cycling switch condensation around rear washer fluid container drain completely
crammed engine little hope typical parts somewhat expensive normal Ford parts underside plastic like sharp driveways speedbumps typical
assembly gripes tape radiator screw fell dash seat seams stitched properly
Hopefully fluke
Ford gives key car
Ford spend extra pennies
Rear hatch padding corners
waiting day bash head corner
horn buttons behind air bag spokes center personal preference Tires fling onto side car Likes engine definitely handling good FWD understeer limits transmission speed must usable instrumentation lovely readable analog everywhere little torque steer full power much better SHO drive stability high gearing though low cowl good visibility front Heated outside mirrors nice fog never tested freezing weather bag see rear seats fold rear seat passengers trunk important noises going still
Tires Goodyear Eagles left hoping see primarily interested engine
uummmph car turbo rush big selling point value liter engine
overall car good buy money
market segment changed much since July Prelude VTEC Honda Del Sol
drive work day relatively smooth roads noticable thing Probe suspension like potholes
test drive one find potholed road somewhere around town see jarring get tolerable
passengers means bring along
find room back find car rides differently better
Also lot glass around expecting temperature inside car gets pretty hot summer
back seat passengers complain lack ventilation may want consider combined heat
heard exhaust system trouble mine works fine
Leather keyless entry system available got car ca comment got car officially announced
prefer cloth leather anyway
would want car snow suspension rough inevitable surprise potholes tires meant snow seats assume wearing lots thick clothing
Rain much better water generally beads windshield freeway speed windshield wiper controls easy understandable barely hydroplaned Eagles really trying
also definite lack cup storage places
GT map holders speakers door rigid plastic could fit two cassettes CD max
center rest cup holder back front seats cloth pouch
change holders
Quite SHO
Probe definitely car car
Lastly store wet car covers back

dispute production cars automatics inherently lossy manuals
theory
point along whatever mechanical advantages manual automatic easily lost driver skillful One thing gives automatic advantage launch fact torque converter vs clutch
know sounds strange torque converter multiplies engine output launching
functions sort limited Continuously Variable Transmission
Typically get torque multiplication times depending stall speed
yet see torque multiplier installed production automobile
systems exist none presently installed production autos aware
commonly called viscous drive CVTs fluidic amplifiers
Contrasted clutch merely slips feathered result TQ mult convertor allow engine closer torque peak launch clutched car fully engage driveline
Chevy proved many years ago Camaro ETs terminal mile times close enough tpo identical speed auto cars
Note also major reason auto car get away fewer gears manual slip convertor makes fewer ratios everyone starts yelling proposed sspeed autos soon note manufacturers using speed manulas
past lauch however converter begins coupling TQ multiplication effect reduced cam

question good years consider reliability looks horsepower order believe horsepower main concern want go fast get motorcycle good prices
vettes basic chassis
add aluminum weaker rear housing

male single might wait get car lower insurance
Would fact mainly drive car lower
type classic car rarely driven insurance class driving miles per year
dad vette say insurance
Basically means restricted amount driving time basically means cant used every day car would probably suit needs limited mileage
origional inquires insurance agent drive convertable miles less per year must keep locked garage cost stated value per year sound right
also looking vettes recently found convertible like dealer
currently Ford Escort GT insured State Farm
called em asked rates sell escort vette insurance per months
keep escort vette insurance per months

male good driver discount
Another variable would live
Best bet call insurance brokers get quote

look newspaper call dealers find going rate adjust condition car
get values went selling price car
dealer asking price need research find reasonable
case told State Farm value

car miles car virtually immaculate
clearcoat paint job devoid large chips dents although front covered lots small scratches surprising since miles spent highway
driven smaller coupe long bit concerned whether could get used driving larger car
surprise size car bother seems nimble Celica
comparisons Oldsmobile
Visibility driver seat excellent helped mostly small aft door windows front rear window
Parallel parking bit difficult love size
fact starting appreciate large trunk pack drive Washington DC summer
ride later review
Engine anyone even slightly interested SHOs interested Yamaha Shogun engine
disappointed
Base performance engine rpms good
even reasonable launches second gear although make practice
engine revs smoothly eagerly tooling around town require many shifts
good since shifter definitely one weakest points car
later
performance engine rpms may unremarkable undergoes transformation hit higher revs
rpms butterfly valve opens literally hear feel geometry engine changing twelve valves open
engine soars rpm redline treated opinion sweetest sounding around
engine inexplicably sounds OVERJOYED rpm
noticed drive around town constantly watch tach see far rpm
go rpm may punch accelerator torque adequate come fully online valves used
Transmission first reviewed car marvelled Ford put wimpy clutch balky shifter car
remember driving friend parent SHO remember thinking whether leg strength drive car traffic clutch stiff
back
entire clutch assembly SHO replaced Ford recall
clutch SHO feels stiffer one Toyota Celica
fact friction point seems bit larger forgiving
playing shifter car parked shifter felt reasonable
gates expect shifting action smooth
road much shift SLOWLY
Make mistake clumsy shifter
hurrying shifts like initially trying impress friends consistently miss shift often grope clumsily shift sometimes even muff shift
find pretty amazing car like
also took several days realize get smoothest shifts take time
Seems obvious compared Toyota friend Honda seems atrocious clumsy
Someone noted CRXs blow SHOs incredibly clumsy shifter
shift much sedately shifter seems reasonable
play within bounds shifter works smoothly surprises
know whether rod shifter upgrade would help
Along lines initially trouble shifting gears smoothly
slowing shifts taking care match revs letting clutch helped immensely
took several days get hang
think problems never car enough power balk bad shifts higher gears
Occasionally trouble shifting reverse
shifter refuses enter gate often grind synchros trying get gear
watching carefully next couple months
quirk upshift engine drops back rpm hear whirring grinding noise coming engine compartment
terribly loud passenger definitely hear
asked looking car passengers
Apparently definitely SHO sound gearbox apparently called gear rollover
Replies queries end review
Exterior mentioned astounded well body SHO stood
Paint chipping front bumper grille virtually
Looking older Tauri sometimes age gracefully wonder guys Ford differently SHO bodies
body opinion extremely attractive matching color body moldings stock Tauri
odd reason SHO seems different enough vanilla Tauri get stares stoplights course could overactive imagination

comments please
driver passenger seat lumbar side bolsters

left side bolster driver cracked convinced right bolster inflating way
big surprise forgot SHOs normal hand parking brake
Instead regular parking brake press left foot
bad
getting used seems bit anachronistic
Ride suspension nice stiff

stiffer car
friend new Toyota Celica ST seems tauter still able soak bumps better

Driving railroad tracks noisy jarring affair
hand taking turns feels wonderful body rigid flex listened bought car
highway ride great
drove car Chicago back Purdue trouble keeping mph let alone trying see mph really feels like
relatively quiet ride sunroof rattles

easy way get rid think
past three days oscillated thinking suspension wonderful perfect thinking ride way rough

wonder whether would advise dad buy one
discovered shifter take time shifts reason complain
Let explain
ride worst turning applying lots power wheels
feel wheels scrabbling traction torque steer making car skitter left right
understood avoid limits traction happy camper
body rigidity composure car
matching suspension steering feel quite heavy
first impression driving SHO hard turn wheel highway speeds
tracks straight arrow driving around parking lot steering seem useful
However reasonable communicate road driver well Ford Probe GT
IMHO much better steering Celica ST
wonder bad car winter
Miscellaneous notes GRIPES rattles sunroof intermittent days rattles loudly days look wondering noise went
Activating sunroof sometimes noisy loud squealing retracts rails
wonder quick fix
days completely disappears
Function humidity
made connection sometimes awful feeling suspension torque steer never complained ride
wish seats support thighs
Also wish side bolsters would close tightly
hear tires car get really expensive
currently Goodyear cost previous owner four
used hate Ford stereo systems whose idea use volume paddle
amazement really mind sometimes think okay idea
Pretty ridiculous though
Getting rpm sometimes seems chore
big deal
enough torque low
often goof shifting driving friends
took couple days could really shift smoothly gear
Hard believe
car almost miles
parents noted almost impossible find SHO
Astute observation IMHO
wonder long make SHO last bought book titled Drive Forever tips department
goofy parking brake pedal still throws loop
parked car gear accidentally let clutch started
car jolted forward bounced car front paint damage starting car whole new ritual fangled pedal
Also began wonder strong brake really
Today backed parking spot today started drive away noticed glowing brake light
Oops

like thinking getting another car point time sure buy another SHO

Newsgroup eliot eliot Subject REVIEW Audi quattro since reviewed car today paid visit old friend whose love Audis overwhelming makes sucessful living selling
Without delay get Audi Servotronic steering familiar Servotronic name speed variable power steering manufactured ZF used Audis BMWs
outspoken damming Servotronic past couple months based magazine reviews drives Audi CS quattro Audi fwd
quite happy report Servotronic inoffensive
suppose due fat gumball tires Servotronic loaded far best implementation tried
far perfect mind much happier option could refuse longer consider bad enough feel entire car ruined
steering still tad light accurate suppose stiffly sprung chassis sends back much information makes driver hands
feel accuracy steering
also room improvement
consider steering better Japanese competition primarily Japanese believe feel engineer completely
Engine Wheee
pressure cooker
miles clock expect producing anywhere close putting miles later still car packs terrific punch
turbocharged machine unusual encourages lazy driving

low revs high gear
supremely flexible one could hardly believe liters displacement move pound car around fashion
maximum torque available rpm rpm redline car pretty much left third day translates speed range something like mph
chracteristic one normally associates large capacity
technical achievement breadthtaking
Throttle response right good atmospheric engine
fact would even put peaky multivalve engines shame
Downshifts almost unnecessary
fun use overboost feature rev engine
familiar engine features seconds additional turbo boost passing
Sort like lighting burners jet fighter one could right foot third gear blast car moments simply flooring gas
far numbers go maximum torque available overboost mode shoots lb ft incredible liter
takes moments develop overboost well worth waiting
Since quite heavy car one body parts flung around like say Corrado
acceleration smooth strong somewhat similar riding jetliner accelerates runway takeoff
Also one treated distinctive entertaining whistle turbo entertaining sound come refined bland sounding banger
Yes Audi refined point rpm sounds serene
smoothness outstanding quite standards good
valve BMW
say terms refinement
willingness rev smoothness lack harshness full acceleration better many
However lost refinement process characteristic cylinder bark made older engines characterful terribly refined
valve turbo sounds pretty bland except whistle full boost
Subjectively rate VW engine far musical turbo Also Audi also far musical rorty race car growl pressed though none match grunt
hint engine true capacity occurs one taking rest turbo come near stop
extra inertia permanently engaged system one somewhat delicate feeding clutch prevent embarassing stall
Alternately one could use revs
cases small price pay fantastic engine
think Audi America offer automatic option car offer though extremely small numbers speed much peakier
characteristics engine perfect automatic
Ironically europe slush available none offered land slush
Marketing twits rearing ugly heads Chassis noticed Audis tend wide wheels relatively modest tire widths
car comes Firestones size uncommon
However attractive spoke wheels less inches wide sidewall bulge whatsoever
Combined flared wheel arches mouth watering macho yet subdued look
rough concrete becomes immediately clear new body style made significant advances structural rigidity well road noise suppression
suppose two digress
use cliche body feels like carved stone
Flex totally undetectable even going rough roads
super rigid body like stiff springs stiff dampers cause excessive harshness ride quality never worry Lexus also draw comparisons trucks pony cars
servotronic steering already mentioned
consider inoffensive inhibit spirited cornering
able test car cornering powers without much trepidation
think new concept work car
fat gumball tires talking understeer oversteer practically meaningless
banked highway ramp went slow started applying power went around
could feel g forces build point skin face tugged sideways
Yet car totally completely obedient throttle steering inputs
felt limits even close approached
g forces thrilling entire affair going around curve strangely uninvolving
tell car want
End story
think starting relate reviewers highly impressed Honda NSX clinical efficiency unable fall love car
brakes good firmness stop car pretty well though read prone fade
surprised since uprated brakes base Audi fwd
Harder pads would help turn would lead wooden response cold
starting see trend among sedan makers extra weight offset additional braking capacity
fade performance nothing brag neither Legend
Brake fade days seem forgotten virtue everybody attention focused capability
Comfort car sporty abilities comfort levels also excellent
cabin beautifully appointed panel inserts place wood trim
expected gizmos heated seats power seats seat memory power
glaring ommision trip computer removed Audi gotten work reliably yet means car boost gauge
real disappointment taking account much turbo dominates performance
Unusual germans comes Honda style moonroof well intelligent rotary switch
Noise levels including engine tire noise low consider Lexus advantage area significant enough sway potential buyer
Conclusion Even though able afford Audi sticker price car bargain one takes account offer competition
valve turbo real gem even produce Ferrari sounds
sedan maker offers utter security quattro wheel drive worth extra money
safety features also top notch side impact standard compliant elegant automatic seat belt tensioners dual airbags
series Audis outstanding government crash tests
gets thumbs overwhelmingly capable rather exciting intoxicating

understand tell microwaves coming front rear

Bogey counts determined sources relative strength one another even reflections source



sounds like analysis based hypothesis actually using
like give feedback based real life experince
keep advanced logic mode rarely lights Christmas tree
time middle major shopping area makes sense since sources coming many different directions
found consistent reporting bogeys regardless moving cars area
found directional indication useful
one case two radar traps set within one mile
passed first radar trap direction indication changed
detector set pointing forward direction
radar detectors would assumed due reflection
knew high probability another trap

occasions directional helped discern false alarm true alarm
example pass source direction indicator changes
directional also allows focus attention signal might coming instead look place
car approaching rear detector leaks tell signal coming rear car passes verify source
detectors would unable would assume radar trap none
several months find added features useful gimmicks

Cd related drag force effects top speed fuel consumption
drag force car aircraft greater vehicle engine overcome reached top speed
autos course also overcome rolling resistance Since drag opposes vehicle motion engine must make burning fuel
Anyway since geometery auto rather complex Drag pressure coeffiecent etc either found experimentaly using numerical method

recently car mangled broken decided get alarm installed
Viper shock sensor sensors door ignition cutoff automatic door locks
alarm installed Syclone
works great
shock sensor sensitive much practical motion sensor car
trigger car rocked gently wind kind shock sets
Even kicking tire sets
works great
worries hood hatch
someone could pry gently enough could bypass alarm
shock sensor adjustable two cycles
adjust sensitive enough way could open hood without setting alarm
Although know pop hood Syclone without setting alarm yet zero none
false alarms system
alarm tells disarm whether activated absence
able trace every alarm cause false alarm
also wondering easy would thief crawl underneath car cut battery cable disable alarm
guess would possible depending vehicle
Syclone tight engine compartment would tough
supplemental power supplies put Viper alarm one
really think someone wants car bad alarm wo keep even supplemental power supply
Viper also sells fancy field disturbance sensor supposedly detects people approcahing car primarily convertibles
convertible looked feature detail
Alpine actually makes better radar unit want get one
zones shut independently one side car pedestrian traffic something else would trigger alarm shuts zone rather pulls tighter
see real benefit unless convertible leave top
Avoid voice alarm added radar package
talks people walk
saw one installed Lotus Esprit
kids would taunt seeing close could get get back
owner finally disabled defeats purpose mind

real happy Viper

engine sound somewhat like truck
understanding btw engine designed originally intention aptible either trucks Viper

account depreciation
seriously doubt taurus would rack extra repair costs years
